/// <summary>
/// A Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) is an algorithm used in distributed systems to track the order of events.
/// It combines elements of both physical clocks and logical clocks to achieve a more accurate and consistent
/// ordering of events across different nodes in a distributed system.
///
/// Physical Clocks: HLC uses the physical time from the system clocks of the machines in the network.However,
/// relying solely on physical clocks can lead to issues due to clock drift and synchronization problems.
///
/// Logical Clocks: To address the limitations of physical clocks, HLC also incorporates a logical component.
/// Logical clocks are a method of ordering events based on the causality relationship rather than actual time.
/// They increment with each event, ensuring a unique and consistent order.
///
/// Hybrid Approach: HLC merges these two approaches. It uses physical time when possible to keep the logical
/// clock close to real time.However, when the physical clock is behind the logical clock (due to clock drift
/// or other reasons), the logical component of the HLC advances to maintain the order.
///
/// Event Ordering: In a distributed system, when a message is sent from one node to another, the HLC timestamp
/// of the sender is sent along with the message.The receiving node then adjusts its HLC based on the received timestamp,
/// ensuring a consistent and ordered view of events across the system.
///
/// Advantages: HLC provides a more accurate representation of time in distributed systems compared to purely
/// logical clocks. It ensures causality and can approximate real-time more closely, making it useful for systems
/// where time ordering is crucial.
